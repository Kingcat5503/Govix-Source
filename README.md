# Govix Linux

Govix is a spiritual-minded Arch Linux based operating system that harmoniously combines the essence of Shree Krishna's teachings with the power of Linux. The name "Govix" itself represents this unique fusion - "Go" referring to Krishna (who is also known as Govinda) and "vix" representing the technological aspect of Linux.
